Hello, and welcome, to my GitHub page! My name is Christian Trelenberg.
I am a recent graduate from the University of the Fraser Valley with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Physics. My experiences have exposed me multiple times to artificial intelligence and the uses of pandas and sklearn.

I love the pursuit of learning. I am continuing my growth by learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C#.
